Rummage through your old china—or find vintage mismatched pieces at a garage sale— to create this pretty tiered display. Use a large china plate as the base, then stack teacups and smaller plates. Add fresh or artificial orange flowers on each level, and place a small amount of foliage in the top teacup."

Red silk leaves give a color pop to this fall wreath. Start with a premade twig wreath. Fluff husks and arrange ears around the center of the wreath (mini ears work best). Attach corn with wire or hot glue, then add silk leaves with a dab of glue."
