This thankful turkey can be a decoration all month long or constructed just before your Thanksgiving dinner. To create this project, begin with a large pinecone. Cut feather shapes from scrapbook paper, crease them in half lengthwise and fringe the edges with scissors. Construct the turkey's head by cutting out an oval and a circle and adding googly eyes, a beak and a wattle. Have family or guests write what they're thankful for on the feathers and tuck feathers into pinecone."
