Fashion flowers from corn husks for seasonal napkin rings. To create the flower, cut a freehand spiral from a soaked corn husk so it has at least four rings. Starting from the outside, roll up the spiral. This will form a rose shape. Let dry; the rose should hold its shape loosely. Secure with gel glue. Glue a circle to the base. For the ring, cut out a rectangle and fold to form a loop. Hot-glue ends. Glue flower to the top, and youâ€™re ready!"
