One of the best gifts you can give a busy mother on-the-go is a pair of comfortable shoes. These smoking slippers with espadrille-style lining also look great on a family jaunt to Mexico ... just sayin'. "

If you were the kid your mom could never get out of bed, apologize with this chic smartwatch. It reads text messages, can adjust music volume and in our GH Lab test, it had great battery life and won extra points for being so comfortable. "

There's one octogenarian that feminists of all ages can agree on: Ruth Bader Ginsburg. This hilarious book was inspired by the Internet, but will inspire your mom to be as bad to the bone as this Supreme Court Justice. "

She's already gorgeous, but if Mom needs a second opinion on the latest and greatest beauty products, that's where you come in. This night cream won our test because it hydrated and improved texture without irritating skin. "
