In the Victorian era, you'd have been hard-pressed to find a table that wasn't topped with a crocheted doily. Today, these handmade bits of lace (which to us look like delicate snowflakes) are more likely to be tucked away in linen closets or piled up at yard sales. Give them a flurry of new life this winter by turning them into a country-chic table runner."
