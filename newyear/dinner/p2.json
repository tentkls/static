Black, white and neon yellow aren't the traditional palette, but they look fresh on baubles and paper Christmas trees. For each not-so evergreen, use printed card stock or paint on your own mod patterns. "

Play up the vintage appeal of old-fashioned peppermint sticks with antique silver. The tarnished finish only adds to the look, so go ahead and skip the polish. "
